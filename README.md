# Compiler
In this project, the goal was to master the basic concepts used in the development of compilers for higher-level programming languages. The task was to create a compiler for a simpler programming language that I defined myself. The project was divided into several stages: writing the grammar, implementing the lexer, implementing the parser, and the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
